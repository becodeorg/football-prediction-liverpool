📢 **Championship Match Prediction Project – Grading Scheme**

Your predictions will be evaluated after 3 weekends of Championship football (24 matches from 08/08 to 24/08). Probabilities must be submitted **no later than next Tuesday 07/08**.

Here’s how your final score will be calculated:

---

### 🧠 **DS – Data Science Score**  
**Formula:** `2 × (1 - Brier Score)`  
- Assesses the accuracy and calibration of your probabilistic predictions.
- A **lower Brier Score = better predictions = higher score**.
- Max: **2 point**
- Min: **-2 point**
The reason for the multiplier is that its trivial to have a 0.66 Brier score.

### 📊 **DA – Demo & Audience Score**

- Voting system:

  - **SNP group (not doing the project):** Ranks 4 favorites with 4-3-2-1 points
- Your score: `Your total votes / 13`
- Max: **1 point**
